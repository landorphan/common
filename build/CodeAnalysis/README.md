### Suggestion:
Do not edit project *.ruleset files.  Pick the scope of impact and edit the *.ruleset files located in *build* directory, then execute Copy-FxCop-Rulesets.ps1


Note: Merging rulesets was possible, I have no idea if it is now.  I suggest this pattern until we find a rule Action specific to an individual project.

#### CustomDictionary.xml
This is a custom dictionary for .Net Framework projects
Add it as a link to .Net Framework projects and set the BuildAction=CodeAnalysisDictionary
