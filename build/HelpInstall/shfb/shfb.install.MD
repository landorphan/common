# SandcastleHelpFileBuilder (SHFB)

You can find the current version of SHFB here:  https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB

The guided install worked well for me, but did not detect the lack of MSBuild Tools 2015:  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=48159

The project structure does not work well with .Net Core, .Net Standard, nor Microsoft Nuget packages.  For example, member documentation that references
System.Collections.Immutable is removed.  The author states it is because the nuget packages contain xml documentation that is not well formed <TODO>
